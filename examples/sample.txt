The MapReduce programming model has been successfully used by Google for many different purposes.
This distributed computing approach can process vast amounts of data in parallel.
MapReduce is inspired by the map and reduce functions commonly used in functional programming.
The framework handles all the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling program execution across machines.
Fault tolerance is a key feature of MapReduce - when a machine fails, its work is redistributed.
The distributed nature of MapReduce allows for massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of machines.
This makes it possible to process very large datasets efficiently and reliably.
